I'm trying to decode this string 16 9 3 15 3 20 6 {20 

It looks like you're working with a string of numbers and possibly some symbols. However, it's not clear what encoding or decoding method is being used. If you provide more information or context about the encoding/decoding scheme, I may be able to help you better.

For example, if this is a simple letter-number substitution (A=1, B=2, etc.), then your string "16 9 3 15 3 20 6 {20" might decode to "PICTOFTF{20", but this is just a speculative example.

If you have additional details about the encoding method or any rules that apply, please share them so I can assist you more accurately.

If we use a simple letter-number substitution (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26), the sequence "20 8 5 14 21 13 2 5 18 19 13 1 19 15 14" would decode to:
