Can you figure out what is in the eax register? 
Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: 
picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. 
If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}. Download the assembly dump here.

HINT
As with most assembly, there is a lot of noise in the instruction dump.
